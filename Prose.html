      <p>
      As soon as she was hit with the realization that he was never coming back, she knew that there would be no happy ending for her. Backtrack for a moment, her name was Zoey, the classic American teenager with her head in the clouds dreaming about him. Cody Williams was the classic high-school jock that had everybody wrapped around his finger but he wasn’t perfect. Derek was Cody’s father and let’s just say he wasn’t even close to being father of the year, but even so Cody was still the kindest person on campus. Exhausted after playing football afterschool, Cody went to go sit down next to Zoey. Flustered as Zoey was she calmly made conversation with Cody asked if he wanted to go to a movie on Friday and to her surprise he said yes! Going to the movies was the easy part but nobody could have expected what would happen next. Halfway home, the two of them started to get lost and went up to an old house to ask for directions. Inside the old house seemed to be something rocking on the chair so Zoey and Cody knocked on the front door. Just barely, the two of them heard the faintest creak coming from inside and the door swung open. Knowing that something bad was going to happen shivers were sent down both of their spines. Lingering for the longest time, they finally entered the house trying to see if the owner was inside. Many people would think that it was a bad idea to go into that house if it was abandoned but at that point Zoey and Cody were desperate for directions since it was already past their curfew. Nobody was inside so Cody decided to look for somebody else to ask outside. Other than a confused old man with a name tag reading Xavier there was nobody outside so Cody decided to take his chances with the confused man rather than in a creepy old house. Perhaps the fear was starting to get to Zoey as well because not soon after she started to speed walk toward the door. Quickly, Cody exited the house with Zoey not far behind but suddenly the door slammed shut before Zoey could escape. Restlessly, Zoey started frantically shaking the door knob, pounding on the door and yelling for Cody but there was no reply. She thought that he had just gone to get help but after minutes went by she lost hope and started to look for a way out herself. There was a cracked window that was easily breakable with a little force so Zoey backed into a corner, found a heavy knickknack and threw it as hard as she could at the window and it worked! Underneath the window was a pile of glass shards but Zoey still ran to jump through the window but then she heard something. “Veronica,” the voice said, “come back to me.” Without taking a moment to listen closer Zoey jumped out of the window and ran as far away as she could towards Xavier, the old man. Xavier had a warm smile on his face when Zoey came up and asked where Cody was. “You’re her...” the old man said while pausing and sighing, “Cody told me to tell you that he can’t do this anymore and you deserve better.” Zoey had tears running down her face but she understood and went on with her life never forgetting that day.

<p>
  I’ve never given much thought to how dangerous the world really is because I have always been so consumed in my own problems. My mother died when I was young and even though we had all the money in the world I still felt unloved. My father was barely a father to me because he only knew how to punish me so I basically had to raise myself. My entire life I have never had a friend who truly loved me and my life was the opposite of a melodrama seen on television. I always felt alone and unwanted so when I was kidnapped I wasn’t afraid of leaving anyone behind.
</p>
<p>
  The night that changed my life was cold and dark. There was no one but the K squad in front of me (Kelsie, Kenzie, and Kelly). I was just listening to my music, covering any bruises left from last night when a man came up behind me. I thought nothing of it at first but when he started to pick up his pace I knew something was wrong. In response, I started to pick up my pace and slowly went into a running speed. I wasn’t looking ahead and I crashed into Kelsie, Kenzie, and Kelly. The man came to a stop and pulled out four black body bags. He injected us with some kind of drug and as I started to close my eyes he started putting us in bags. I woke up in a small room with the same three girls. I sat up right away and saw that the other girls were petrified. I told them to calm down so that we could find a way out. They covered their mouths but I saw the tears running down their faces. I started to press the walls, searching for hollow knocks which could be a possible escape route, and I found one possible exit on the ceiling. I stood on the bed and measured how big the hollow area was. I determined that it was an air duct but before I could break open the wall a man came in. He had a camera and some rope. He tied us up and even though we tried to break free, there was no hope. Once we were tied up he set up the camera and pulled a gun from his pocket. The other girls were screaming for help but I stayed quiet. He pressed record and pointed the gun at our heads. He urged us to beg for help and show as much fear as we could.
</p>
<p>
  While the other girls were uncontrollably screaming I calmly asked, “What do you want?” That’s when he spoke. He said, “I need a million dollar ransom from each of your families within 48 hours or else I will shoot each of you and leave your bodies someplace for your parents to find.” That’s when he turned the camera on himself and repeated the phrase, “48 hours or else your children die.” Then, he shut off the camera and exited the room with our hands and legs still tied up.
</p>
<p>
  Kenzie was screaming while Kelsie and Kelly were struggling to break free. It was so annoying and I kept thinking to myself,  of all the girls I had to be stuck with, it had to be the ones with the least knowledge of common sense! I managed to escape by breaking my finger and slipping out of the restraints, with no help from them. Then, I quickly undid the girls’ restraints and the restraints on my feet. The door was still locked so I told the girls to look through the keyhole and make sure that the man wasn’t coming back while I opened the vent. When I opened it the vent was closed off and there was truly no escape. I quickly cleaned off the dust and closed the vent before I told the others that there was no other way out.
</p>
<p>
  That’s when Kelsie came out and said, “What if we knock that man out when he comes in here next and escape through the front door?” I was astonished because that was the first good idea that any of these girls had since we had been here.
</p>
<p>
  We came up with a plan and waited for him to come in. Kelsie and Kelly would be the distraction, Kenzie would be the look out, and I would knock him out with a metal rod I pulled from the bed. We didn’t have to wait long because within a few minutes he came in to tell us that we only had 30 minutes left to live, so we set the plan in motion.
</p>
<p>
  I hid under the bed when he entered while Kelsie and Kelly drew his attention to the other side of the room. Slowly and carefully, I stepped out from under the bed and hit him round the head with the metal rod. He was out cold and we bolted out of the door into what seemed like a fortress. We chose to divide and conquer. I went to the right while the K squad went to the left. As I wandered around aimlessly, I found a locked window which could be easily broken with the metal rod I kept in my hand.  I called for the other girls but heard no response. I started to get worried as I called them again. I slowly surveyed my surroundings and walked in search of the girls. Not long after I heard a scream. This is when I started to run in hopes that they were still alive. As I turned the corner I ran into Kelsie. She was crying and stammering in fear. I told her to calm down and she finally said, “They’re dead! They’re dead! He wasn’t alone! We are not alone here! Run!” She pulled my arm and we started running in the other direction.
</p>
<p>
  Once we reached the window, I hit it with all my strength and broke it on the first try. I was clearing off the glass when I heard it. “Where are you? Don’t you want to see your friends again? I can make it happen.” With fear running through our spines we climbed through the window and ran into a clearing not far off. We took a deep breath and discussed what we should do next. It wasn’t easy because Kelsie was in tears.
</p>
<p>
  I tried to calm her down but that’s when I noticed that her hands were covered with blood. I assumed that it was from the glass but when I took a closer look, there were no cuts. It was someone else’s blood. It didn’t take long to realize that she was not all I thought she was. I asked her about it but she just denied it and tried to convince me that it was her blood. I started to back away and this is when she started to laugh. Her laugh made shivers run up and down my spine and made me shake in fear. As she came closer I saw the shine of a knife. I ran as fast as I could the other way but a man with a very large bat came at me. From my peripheral vision I could see the man that we knocked out coming at me with a very large machete. There was no escape for me. All I could think about was how nobody would miss me and I would die alone.
</p>
  While I was trying to find another way out I heard sirens. Apparently Kenzie’s, Kelly’s, and my dad all called the cops and found us right before the deadline was up. That’s when the killers all fled the scene and they were never found. After the cops investigated, we were told that the main kidnapper was the father of Kelsie and they have done this to many other kids, with rich families, before. I was lucky to survive unlike Kenzie and Kelly.
</p>
<p>
  The next few weeks were full of despair, funerals, and lots of therapy but that situation made me think about how I had been wasting my life; so from that moment onwards I promised myself that I would be better. I promised that I would be a better daughter and a better friend. I would always have something to live for, so I would have more hope for the future.

      <b>Loss</b>
      <p>
Everybody experiences loss at least once in their life because it’s just a part of living, and it is a feeling that never just comes and goes, so there are different approaches to this dreadful feeling.
</p>
There is nothing more devastating than the feeling of loss and regret. Once something is lost it leaves a hole in the heart and it almost seems impossible to repair or replace. There are only a few things that can diminish the pain of a loss, the most important of which is love and family. One way to deal with loss can take years to move on. When someone dies all a person really wants to do is make the world stop but instead it feels like the world is moving on without him/her. People stop caring and eventually people forget but not the person who had it the worst. When the world moved on way too fast it can be far too much for some people to bear but they can’t just stop time. Some people can find the strength to move on but some don’t. Those who don’t choose to live every day in isolation, putting up a wall with everyone he/she meets. This wall prevents him/her from getting hurt but it also prevents him/her from loving or feeling. Sometimes somebody will come to knock down that
wall but if nobody is there that wall stays up forever. That wall becomes his/her only friend and he/she just has to go on with no meaning and no purpose. Everyone keeps telling him/her that it's been a lifetime and he or she has to let it go so he or she tries. It doesn’t work the first time so the person waits and tries again but after so long of being cut off, isolation just becomes second nature. It’s almost a cycle that never ends because he or she’s alone and nothing can change that.
<p>
<p>
There is another way to handle loss. This kind of person doesn’t get knocked down by loss but gets stronger. They start to fight for what they believe in and fight to keep their family safe. They don’t hide, they thrive. They still mourn but they don’t stop their lives to drown in regret and self-hate. They don’t hide because they know that their loved one would want them to keep going and live their life. They move on and doesn’t let time leave them behind. This isn’t everyone because it entirely depends on the type of person.
</p>
<p>
I have lost so many people in my life...some are still alive but they have betrayed me so much that they seem dead to me. I have lost my grandparents and some of my cousins and it took a while to move on because they meant the world to me. When someone means that much to you, there is no switch that can be used to turn off your emotions. I lost a lot of people in a single year and I went into a downward spiral for months. I resented myself for not spending enough time with them and this feeling of guilt and depression didn’t go away so I isolated myself. I became introverted and closed off. I had no friends but one day I chose to think differently. I started telling myself that everything happens for a reason and everyone’s time will come eventually. This is when I started to turn my life around. I started opening myself to new relationships but those months of being isolated stayed with me and I am still scared to put myself out there but I am better off than two years ago.
</p>
<p>
Loss is complicated and deals with people in different ways, but no matter who it is they can get past it if they choose to do so.

      <strong>Broken Love Story</strong>
      <br>
      As I stand at the point where two paths meet
      <br>
      I finally feel at peace
      <br>
      Maybe it’s because I see two distinct paths
      <br>
      Maybe it’s because I can see that I have a choice
      <br>
      Maybe it’s because I remember the path that led me here
      <br>
      The path where I met him
      <br>
      <br>
      When the night was cold but we had each other to keep warm
      <br>
      When we didn’t have a care in the world 
      <br>
      I remember how your smile could bring light into the darkest corners of my life
      <br>
      I remember how your laugh would make me smile ear to ear
      <br>
      Maybe we could have been happy
      <br>
      Maybe we could have had a good life
      <br>
      If only you didn’t leave
      <br>
      If only you didn’t keep the truth from me
      <br>
      I kept blaming you
      <br>
      Kept accusing you
      <br>
      For all the regrets that I had
      <br>
      Maybe because I stopped being myself after you left
      <br>
      Maybe it was a test that I failed and couldn’t clean up the mess
      <br>
      After you left I couldn’t see clearly, feel clearly
      <br>
      Maybe that’s why the rain feels colder and the skies look grayer
      <br>
      Maybe that’s why I can’t feel the warmth from the sun
      <br>
      <br>
      Maybe that’s why I stayed at home for months
      <br>
      With a wall standing tall not letting a ray of hope peek through
      <br>
      Maybe I didn’t want to break the cycle
      <br>
      Maybe I didn’t want to feel
      <br>
      Maybe that’s why I could never let you go
      <br>
      <br>
      It took years to get to the point when I finally had a choice
      <br>
      One, to go straight and continue the cycle
      <br>
      To stay on the neverending ride of pain
      <br>
      With no one to stand by
      <br>
      Or I could go right
      <br>
      I could look at the glass half full
      <br>
      I could let love in
      <br>
      I could start again
      <br>
      Without assuming that my life is worthless
      <br>
      Without assuming that this is what fate had planned for me
      <br>
      <br>
      But instead to make an impact
      <br>
      To not let one event define me
      <br>
      Maybe I could do it
      <br>
      Maybe I could change
      <br>
      Maybe I could make a difference
      <br>
      But only if I choose to walk the path">

      <strong>I Remember</strong>
      <br>
      I remember the day that I almost died
      <br>
      I remember the sharp pain in my chest I felt every time I yelled for help
      <br>
      I remember the screaming of others while I started to fade away
      <br>
      I remember the struggle of getting up
      <br>
      I remember the surrounding people telling me “It’ll be alright”
      <br>
      I remember my mother and father crying while my sister stood still, petrified
      <br>
      I remember the sound of the siren heading my way
      <br>
      I remember my mother holding my hand so tight and never letting go
      <br>
      I remember waking up in a hospital bed
      <br>
      I remember the smiles on my family’s faces
      <br>
      I remember the moment when I knew I was going to survive

      <br>
      If I only knew that I wasn’t protecting anyone by leaving

      No matter how far I go I still hear it loud and clear
      <br>
      Just make it stop
      <br>
      The faces don’t look human
      <br>
      They could be animals, demons, angels but not human
      <br>
      They are making my life a living hell
      <br>
      I can’t eat
      <br>
      I can’t sleep

      All I can do is listen to their cries

      If I had three wishes all of them would be to make the voices stop

      Suddenly the voices stop

      The man shook my hand and bid me good day

      I wanted to forgive you but how couldI?

      When I looked in your eyes I never saw a bully
      <br>
      I saw a friend but what did you see in me?
      <br>
      A victim?
      <br>
      Did all the years of friendship not matter to you?
      <br>
      I escaped but will someone else have to?
      <br>
      You made the wrong decision
      <br>
      You decided to ruin lives and for what?
      <br>
      To make yourself feel powerful?
      <br>
      That feeling never lasts
      <br>
      You tormented people for a feeling of power that won’t last?

      At least I have healed

      You gave me everything
      <br>
      Your love, your help, your support
      <br>
      When you are sad my heart aches 
      <br>
      When you are mad my blood boils too
      <br>
      Saying I love you is too simple
      <br>
      Saying you mean more to me than anything in the world is an underestimate
      <br>
      You shine the brightest out of a hundred billion stars
      <br>
      You know what I want before I even think it
      <br>
      You know more about me than I know about myself
      <br>
      You always put me first
      <br>
      I revolve around your love
      <br>
      Your smile can lift me high on the darkest of days
      <br>
      You make life worth living
      <br>
      You give me so much and never ask anything for yourself
      <br>
      You pick me up when I fall down
      <br>
      You make sure I’m alright
      <br>
      You never let me see you cry
      <br>
      You do everything to make sure I have a good life
      <br>
      You make sure I am successful
      <br>
      I may not have said it before but…

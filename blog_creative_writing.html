      <h3><b>Why Should I be Politically Correct?</b></h3>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>To be politically correct you cannot have any opinions and you must stay as neutral as possible. There is no room for error because one wrong move and you will be in a heated argument that you can't get out of. You must think before you speak and you can never share "facts" that can be argued against unless you are debating the subject. If you are not politically correct you can and will be portrayed as a bad person and your reputation will be tarnished. This is why it is important for you to get this topic down right before you mess up in the future. </p>

      <h3><b>Avoid the Conversation</b></h3>
      <h5><span class="w3-opacity">October 8, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>To be politically correct you must avoid sensitive topics. If there is a possibility of there being another opinion, do not even mention it. If you accidentally stumble into a conversation with a bunch of people in a heated argument don't speak. If you are asked for your opinion stay as broad as possible and stay as neutral as possible. Do not use racial or religious terms. Avoid gender-specific topics and discussions because most likely there will be one phrase that will be very specific. Do not risk it. If someone is different do not resent them or show signs of disgust because first of all that's rude and second that will surely lead to an argument that you will lose.</p>
      <p>In 2019, everything is offensive. If you do not realize this, you will offend virtually everyone. Unless you know what you are saying and are sure you will not offend anyone (very unlikely) stay off controversial topics.</p>

      <h3><b>Do Not Try to be Right & Avoid Trendy Topics</b></h3>
      <h5><span class="w3-opacity">October 8, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Do not try to be right. If you try you will be wrong because most likely the other people in the argument will want to be right too. If both people in the argument try to be right the argument will continue to escalate and it will never end. The only way for an argument to end is if someone accepts defeat or leaves. There is no right side to a political argument. If a topic is talked about in the news or is really popular do not have an opinion on it. Once the hype on a topic dies down it fine to have an opinion on it. If a topic is talked about most people will have the majority opinion on the topic to fit in and if you have a different opinion you are a bad person. If you do not find a subject offensive you are, most likely, a very bad person.</p>
